/*

The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.

Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns
The columns must also have similar data types
The columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order

Note: If some customers or suppliers have the same city, each city will only be listed once, 
because UNION selects only distinct values. Use UNION ALL to also select duplicate values!
